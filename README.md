# Scribd document downloader :books: :floppy_disk: :arrow_down:

## Why?
Until recently Scribd allowed a user to upload any document and in exchange for the upload you could download a document for free. This changed recently and this option is no longer available and downloading a document now requires you to enter your credit/debit card details. 

### :exclamation: Note
At this point, the script works only for Scribd documents composed of images. If the text is selectable in the document, this wouldn't work. 

## Usage
```bash
$ npm install
$ node index.js url-of-the-scribd-document
```

## Extensions under development
1. Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey scripts which allow a user to read any Scribd document by removing the blur

## To do
1. Add functionality for Scribd documents with selectable text.
